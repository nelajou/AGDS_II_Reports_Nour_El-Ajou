# 2.1 Literature

Read the paper by Ludwig et al. (2023) and answer the following questions:


## 2.1.1
Explain the difference between a random cross-validation and a spatial cross-validation.

Answer:

Random CV divides the  Data randomly into k Folds, which then are subsequently used to train the model. k times, another of these folds is then used as the Test data and the k-1 other folds as the Training data. After evalutating all of these models, the mean performance can be calculated. 

Random CV generates folds by random samples from the data set at hand. If this data is representative of the Actual Prediction space, RC should return reasonable metrics. 
But if this is not the case, e.g. if one has strongly clustered data, random CV will reproduce this clustering within its folds. 

The main assumption in this context is the independence between different datapoints, which is normally not given for geographical data (i.e. Datapoints near of each other tend to be more similar, which violates there statistical independence. )

Consequently it might be useful to generate folds not randomly, but divide the data based on a different, predefined criteria that reduces the clustering within these folds. Since there is much more environmental data available from the northern, western hemisphere than from all others, one straight forward idea would be to build folds based on geographic clusters and then do the CV. This ist the basic idea of Spatial clustering. Of course, these distances don't have to be measured in geographical space, but can indicate any distance between any variable that might be relevant. 

By building folds which represent different clusters, all of them attribute equally to the final model performance, calculated by the mean of all k Training rounds. Consequently, this would counteract the tendency of the resulting model to heavily represent the most prominent clusters to some extent. 


### Check if its trainings or validation data

# 2.1.2

In spatial upscaling, we model the target based on environmental covariates. This implies that we assume the training data to sufficiently represent the conditions on which the model will be applied for generating predictions. Prediction errors may increase with an increasing distance of the prediction location from the training locations.

The paper by Ludwig et al. (2023) considers this “distance” as a geographical distance in Euclidian space. Do you see an alternative to measuring a distance that considers the task of spatial upscaling based on environmental covariates more directly?

Answer: 

One could still take the Euclidean space, not for geographical distance but the distances of the covariates themselves. Through this, the validity of the estimates, depending on different regions would be more directly linked to the covariate space represented in the training data. 

At the same time geographical distance doesn't seem like a very reasonable indicator, since an extreme high variation of environmental conditions might be encountered in very close geographic space (e.g. through variations in altitude or passing of natural barriers, such as waterbodies and mountain ranges). Consequently, the replacement of this metric by an other does seem reasonable. 


# 2.2 Random Cross Validation

Use Random Forest to perform a 5-fold cross-validation with the leaf N data (leafN) and the following predictors:

elv: Elevation above sea level (m)
mat: mean annual temperature (degrees Celsius)
map: mean annual precipitation (mm yr
)
ndep: atmospheric nitrogen deposition g m
 yr
mai: mean annual daily irradiance µ
mol m
 s
Species: species name of the plant on which leaf N was measured
Report the mean RMSE and R
 across cross-validation folds. Chose hyperparameters as mtry = 3 and min.node.size = 12 and others as their default in ranger::ranger().

## 2.3.1


What do you observe? Discuss the potential implications of the geographical distribution of data points for spatial upscaling.

The wast majoritiy of the datapoints is in Europe and Eastern parts of China. There are some datapoints in North - and South-America, one in northern Africa and some widely dispersed points in central Asia. Consequently, the northern Hemisphere is widely over represented, especially European environment, alongside the northern Monsuun regions in China. Thus c.p., we would expect our model to show a bias  towards environmental conditions, similar to these. 
 
 
 
 Perform a spatial cross-validation. 
 
 To do so, first identify geographical clusters of the data using the k-means algorithm (an unsupervised machine learning method), considering the longitude and latitude of data points and setting 
 

Plot points on a global map, showing the five clusters with distinct colors.

```

  # plot coastline
  geom_sf(data = coast,
          colour = 'black',

# Combine both plots using cowplot package
combined_plot <- plot_grid(curve_plot, boxplot_plot, ncol = 2, labels = c("A", "B"))

print(combined_plot)

## 5.2.3
Split your data into five folds that correspond to the geographical clusters identified by in (2.).

Report the RMSE and the R
 determined on each of the five folds

Compare the results of the spatial cross-validation to the results of the random cross-validation and discuss reasons for why you observe a difference in the cross-validation metrics (if you do).

# Environmental Clustering

2.4 Environmental cross-validation
The central rationale for spatial uspcaling is that we can model based on relationships between the target variable and the environment. The geographic location is not among the predictors. Thus, as long as the training data covers a wide enough range of environmental conditions, we can model for any new location where environmental conditions are within that range, irrespective of its geographical position. The challenge is just that the training data often doesn’t cover all environmental conditions of the globe, yet upscaling is often done for the globe.

Anyways, let’s probe the generalisability of a model not in geographical space, but in environmental space.

To do so, perform a custom cross-validation as above, but this time considering five clusters of points not in geographical space, but in environmental space - spanned by the mean annual precipitation and the mean annual temperature. Report the R-squared and the RMSE on the validation set of each of the five folds.
Compare the results of the environmental cross-validation to the results of the random and the spatial cross-validation and discuss reasons for why you observe a difference in the cross-validation metrics (if you do).

Looking at the MSE , the Model done through random shows the smalllest standard error, followed by the Environmental CV and the Spatial CV, which shows the highest error. 
This said, the rmse's of the latter two models are fairly close to each other. 

This result is expected. Since the data itself is clustered, random CV reproduces this clustering within its folds, which means that the resulting model should show a relatively good fit to such clustered data.

We intentionally corrected for this clustering through the generation of folds based on distance in geographic and predictor space for the other two models, so their fit, to the clustered data is worse , but they should be more useful in predicting for unknown data all over the globe, than the first model. One could also say that the RMSE for the Random CV is underestimated, due to the clustering of the data. 

The mild differens between the RMSE of the environmental and the spatial CV is also expected. We would expect the model, that counteracts the original clustering of the data the most strongly, to show the highest RMSE. Going back to the two global maps, showing the differenct clusteres for both cases, we notice that the first model, only focusing on geographical distance, doesn't differentiate between climatic zones at all. 

The difference persits when the random seed is changed, so it is consistent. This said, it
